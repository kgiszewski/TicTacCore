# TicTacCore

Event-driven .net Core implementation of Tic Tac Toe.

Hobby project, very much a work in progress at this point.

Key things I'm trying to do are:
- Keep the UI separate from the logic by using events to delegate to any UI implementation for the UI interface.
- Have a little fun with the AI strategies
